<u>**STRIDOR**</u>

Stridor is an emergency condition. It has a characteristic noise in the inspiratory phase of breathing. This occurs when there is an obstruction of the upper airway from the nasopharnyx down to the trachea and main bronchi. The obstruction is usually in the subglottic area.

It is commonly a viral illness, and may be preceded usually by the common cold. Measles may also be complicated by Laryngotracheobronchitis (LTB). Two important causes of stridor in children are viral croup (LTB) and acute epiglottitis.

In the management of stridor, steroids are most useful when given within 6 hours of onset of symptoms. Cough syrups containing opiates and atropine are contraindicated.

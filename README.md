**DIGITAL STG PROJECT**

**PROBLEM**

The ***Standard Treatment Guidelines 2017\*** is only available officially in a hardcopy, an online PDF flipper format. The only available PDF was compiled from screenshot/scanned images from the online version. This has resulted in several difficulties in the usage including

\1.   No bookmarks for easy navigation

\2.   Text not searchable


 

**GOALS/AIMS**

We hope to create a digitally friendly format of the STG including

\1.   Mobile app

\2.   Web app

\3.   Desktop app

\4.   PDF version

\5.   DOCX version

 

**IMPLEMENTATION**

We want to convert the STG to make it easy for manipulation in various formats for easy accessibility and effective utilisation.
